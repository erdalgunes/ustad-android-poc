# Sprint Planning Guide

## üéØ Sprint Planning Framework

This guide outlines the sprint planning process for the Ustad Android POC project, following agile methodologies for efficient development and delivery.

## üìã Sprint Planning Process

### Pre-Sprint Preparation (1-2 days before)

#### 1. Backlog Refinement
- Review and update user stories in GitHub Issues
- Ensure stories have clear acceptance criteria
- Estimate story points using planning poker
- Identify dependencies between stories

#### 2. Stakeholder Input
- Gather feedback from previous sprint demo
- Prioritize features based on business value
- Identify any scope changes or new requirements
- Confirm sprint goals with product owner

### Sprint Planning Meeting (2-4 hours)

#### Part 1: What to Deliver (1-2 hours)
1. **Review Sprint Goal**
   - Define clear, measurable sprint objective
   - Align team on business value to be delivered
   
2. **Select User Stories**
   - Choose stories from refined backlog
   - Ensure total story points fit team capacity
   - Validate story dependencies

3. **Validate Sprint Goal**
   - Confirm selected stories support sprint goal
   - Adjust scope if necessary

#### Part 2: How to Deliver (1-2 hours)
1. **Story Breakdown**
   - Break stories into specific tasks
   - Estimate task hours (optional)
   - Identify technical approaches

2. **Assign Ownership**
   - Volunteer for stories based on expertise
   - Ensure balanced workload across team
   - Identify pair programming opportunities

3. **Identify Risks**
   - Technical challenges or unknowns
   - External dependencies
   - Potential blockers

## üìä Sprint Capacity Planning

### Team Velocity Estimation

#### Sprint 1 Baseline
- **Team Size**: 1-2 developers
- **Sprint Duration**: 2 weeks (10 working days)  
- **Estimated Capacity**: 20-30 story points
- **Focus**: Foundation and learning

#### Capacity Factors
- **Development Days**: 8 days per sprint (accounting for meetings)
- **Story Points per Day**: 2-3 (conservative estimate)
- **Buffer**: 20% for unforeseen tasks and learning curve

### Story Point Guidelines

| Story Points | Effort Level | Description | Examples |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | Trivial | <4 hours | Bug fixes, simple UI updates |
| 2 | Small | 4-8 hours | Simple features, minor refactoring |
| 3 | Medium-Small | 1 day | Form validation, API integration |
| 5 | Medium | 2-3 days | Complex UI screens, authentication |
| 8 | Large | 3-5 days | Multi-screen flows, data modeling |
| 13 | Extra Large | 1+ weeks | Major features, architecture changes |

## üé™ Sprint Templates

### Sprint 1: Foundation Template

```markdown
## Sprint 1 Goal
Users can securely register, login, and navigate the basic app structure.

## Selected User Stories
- [ ] #6 Email/Password Registration (5 points)
- [ ] #7 User Login & Session Management (5 points)
- [ ] #8 App Navigation & Home Screen (3 points)

Total: 13 story points

## Sprint Success Criteria
- [ ] Complete user registration flow
- [ ] Secure authentication system
- [ ] Basic app navigation working
- [ ] Development environment fully set up

## Technical Focus Areas
- Authentication architecture
- Navigation component setup
- UI/UX foundation
- Testing framework establishment

## Risks & Mitigation
- OAuth integration complexity ‚Üí Start with basic auth, add OAuth later
- UI framework learning curve ‚Üí Focus on simple, functional designs
- Development environment setup ‚Üí Dedicate first day to environment setup
```

### Sprint 2: Content Template

```markdown
## Sprint 2 Goal
Users can access learning modules and take interactive quizzes with offline capability.

## Selected User Stories
- [ ] #9 Learning Module Content Display (8 points)
- [ ] #10 Interactive Quiz System (8 points)
- [ ] Module Progress Tracking (5 points)
- [ ] Offline Content Access (8 points)

Total: 29 story points

## Sprint Success Criteria
- [ ] 2+ learning modules implemented
- [ ] Quiz system with multiple question types
- [ ] Progress tracking functional
- [ ] Core content available offline

## Technical Focus Areas
- Content management system
- Multimedia integration
- Local data storage
- Quiz logic implementation

## Risks & Mitigation
- Video player integration ‚Üí Use proven libraries (ExoPlayer)
- Offline sync complexity ‚Üí Start with simple caching, iterate
- Quiz scoring accuracy ‚Üí Implement comprehensive testing
```

## üîÑ Daily Sprint Management

### Daily Standup Structure (15 minutes)

#### Round-Robin Format
Each team member answers:
1. **What did I complete yesterday?**
2. **What will I work on today?**
3. **Any blockers or impediments?**

#### GitHub Integration
- Update issue status daily
- Move issues through project board columns
- Link commits to issues for traceability

### Mid-Sprint Check-in (Week 1 Thursday)

#### Review Progress
- Compare actual vs. planned progress
- Identify scope adjustment needs
- Address any emerging risks

#### Adjust as Needed
- Re-prioritize remaining work
- Seek help for blocked items
- Update stakeholder expectations if necessary

## üìà Sprint Metrics Tracking

### Burndown Chart
- Track remaining story points daily
- Visualize progress toward sprint goal
- Identify trend issues early

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- **Story Points Completed**: Daily progress tracking
- **Cycle Time**: Time from start to completion per story
- **Defect Rate**: Bugs found per story point delivered
- **Code Coverage**: Maintain >80% test coverage

### Sprint Health Indicators

#### Green (Healthy)
- ‚úÖ On track for sprint goal
- ‚úÖ No major blockers
- ‚úÖ Team morale high
- ‚úÖ Quality metrics met

#### Yellow (At Risk)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Slight delay but recoverable
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor technical challenges
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need scope adjustment
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Quality metrics trending down

#### Red (Needs Intervention)
- ‚ùå Significant delays
- ‚ùå Major technical blockers
- ‚ùå Sprint goal at risk
- ‚ùå Quality concerns

## üéØ Sprint Review & Retrospective

### Sprint Review (1-2 hours)
1. **Demo Delivered Features**
   - Show working software to stakeholders
   - Gather feedback on implemented features
   - Identify areas for improvement

2. **Review Sprint Metrics**
   - Velocity achieved vs. planned
   - Quality metrics assessment
   - User feedback integration

### Sprint Retrospective (1 hour)
1. **What Went Well?**
   - Celebrate successes and good practices
   - Identify processes to continue

2. **What Could Be Improved?**
   - Honest assessment of challenges
   - Process improvement opportunities

3. **Action Items**
   - Specific, measurable improvements
   - Owner assignment and timeline
   - Follow-up plan for next sprint

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Integration

### GitHub Project Management
- **Issues**: User stories and bug tracking
- **Projects**: Sprint board with columns (Backlog, In Progress, Review, Done)
- **Milestones**: Sprint milestones and release tracking
- **Labels**: Categorization and filtering

### Development Workflow
- **Branch Strategy**: Feature branches from main
- **PR Process**: Code review required before merge
- **CI/CD**: Automated testing and build on PR
- **Documentation**: Update wiki with significant changes
